# Demo for Stakeholders

At the end of each Sprint, a viable product must be ready to demo.

- Team and Product Owner demo to stakeholders the working product at its current state.
- Stakeholders may suggest new User Stories that the team then has to add - the Product Owner is responsible for collecting these and adding them to the Product Backlog.
- This session allows stakeholders to understand the progress of the project and to see what each individual is doing and build relationships with them.
