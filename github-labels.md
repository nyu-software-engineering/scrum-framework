# Labels

Labels allow you to tag an [Issue](./issues.md) in a particular category or context for easy filtering later.

- it's possible to add/remove Labels or assign Issues in bulk to multiple Issues at once in the main Issues list view using checkboxes and the `Labels` and `Assignee` drop-down lists

The following additional labels can be useful for differentiated among different kinds of Issues:

- a label named `user story` to be used for all user stories
- a label named `task` to be used for all tasks
- a label named `spike` to be used for all spikes.

Feel free to create other labels that are useful to your team.
