# Team norms

Teams are well-advised to agree upon a written set of norms and rules upon team formation. These are commitments team members make to each other, often (but not always) including:

- their values as a team
- how they'll work together
- how they'll resolve conflicts
  - how they'll reach consensus when there are disagreements on direction
  - what to do when a member is failing to deliver on their obligations to the team
  - how quickly team members are expected to respond to messages directed at them
- norms of everything and anything
- the definition of done
  - this indicates the minimum requirements that all User Stories must meet to be considered done
  - typically says that all code for each User Story must be peer-reviewed and pass automated tests before merging into the trunk...
- sprint cadence
  - how much time should a sprint take?
  - usually anywhere from 1-4 weeks long, preferably on the shorter side
  - too short sprints create panic and stress
  - too long creates overly relaxed mood
  - just right is in the middle... in our case 2 weeks.
- standups schedule
  - what days/times will standups occur and how long do they last
  - members expected to be present in-person
  - agreement that members will not cover for other members who do not participate`

Keep this document practical and real - make it yours, not someone else's Please don't write in things you know your team is not going to do or care about just because you see other people doing that online.
